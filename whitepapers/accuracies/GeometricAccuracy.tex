\begin{definition}
Let $z$ be the true value of the statistic and let $X$ be the random variable the noisy release is drawn from. Let $\alpha$ be the statistical significance level, and let $Y = \vert X-z \vert.$ Then, accuracy $a$ for a given $\alpha \in [0,1]$ is the $a$ s.t.
$$ \alpha = \pr[Y > a].$$
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
The accuracy of an $\epsilon$-differentially private release from the geometric mechanism on a function with sensitivity $\Delta_1$, at statistical significance level $\alpha$ is
$$ a = \lceil \frac{\Delta_1}{\epsilon}\ln(1/\alpha) \rceil.$$
\end{theorem}\cite{balcer2017differential, ghosh2012universally}

\begin{proof}
This follows directly from the proof of accuracy for the Laplace mechanism, with the observation that the geometric mechanism is simply a discretization of the Laplace mechanism, hence the ceiling in the accuracy statement.
\end{proof}

\subsection{A note on converting from accuracy to privacy}

We offer the ability to convert from an accuracy guarantee to a privacy guarantee in our system. In the context of the geometric mechanism, it is not entirely clear what that conversion would mean, since for a set accuracy level $a$ and significance level $\alpha$, there are a range of possible values for $\epsilon$. Since this range of $\epsilon$ depends on both $a$ \textit{and} $\alpha$, rather than choosing the minimum or maximum over the range of $\epsilon$'s we instead use the original accuracy guarantee from the Laplace mechanism (i.e. the geometric mechanism's accuracy guarantee without the ceiling) to convert from statements about accuracy to statements about privacy:

$$ \epsilon = \frac{\Delta_1}{a}\ln(1/\alpha).$$

One might argue that in general we shouldn't take the ceiling when determining the accuracy, since the additional information might be useful to an end-user. For example, if a user is attempting to determine how much budget to give a query, and they first ask for accuracy for an $\epsilon$ that gives (without the ceiling) $a = 3.02$, they might determine to increase the amount of accuracy to get the accuracy guarantee to $a = 3$. If instead we take the ceiling, they would get back $a = 4$ and not know that a (theoretical) small change in $\epsilon$ would lead to a noticeable improvement in their accuracy guarantee.
